## What is CDBC?

- A CBDC is like the digital version of your country's official money, like a digital dollar or digital euro.
- It's issued and guaranteed directly by the central bank (which is like the main bank for a whole country). This means it's considered very safe, like having real cash in your hand, because the central bank backs it directly.
- It's different from other digital money you might know, like:
    - Money in your bank account: That's money held by a commercial bank (like a regular bank), not directly by the central bank.
    - Money in apps like Alipay or WeChat Pay: These are also run by private companies, not directly by the central bank.
    - Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin: These are usually created and controlled by a network of computers, not by any single government or central bank. CBDC is centralized, meaning the central bank has control.

## CDBC Coexistence With Other Money Form
When new types of money or payment methods come along, it doesn't always mean the old ones completely disappear. It's often more about having more choices and things working together.

### What happens to Cash (physical banknotes and coins)?
- Not likely to disappear entirely: Even though digital payments are becoming super popular and CBDCs are coming, central banks generally say that CBDCs are meant to add to existing money, not totally replace it

#### Reasons why cash might stick around
- Privacy: Cash offers a lot of privacy because your transactions aren't usually tracked. It's considered not feasible to get rid of cash completely because of privacy worries
- Inclusion: Not everyone has a smartphone, internet access, or even a bank account. Cash is still important for these people, especially in remote areas or for vulnerable groups. CBDCs might try to help with financial inclusion, but cash still plays a big role for many
- Choice: Some central banks want to make sure people still have a choice in how they pay, and cash is one of those choices

#### Could Cash Usage Go Down?
Yes. The use of physical cash has already decreased a lot as digital payments have grown. Some countries hope CBDCs can help reduce the costs of printing and moving cash around by taking its place in some ways.

### What happens to E-money (like Alipay or WeChat Pay)
They'll likely stick around and even work with CBDCs: The sources show that CBDCs and existing "Fast Payment Systems" (FPSs) or "e-money networks" (like Alipay and WeChat Pay in China) are often seen as partners or complements, not rivals that replace each other

#### Why CDBC & E-money will Coexist?
- Already popular: Many people already love using apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay because they're super convenient. In China, despite big efforts to promote e-CNY (their CBDC), people often stick to their existing apps and aren't eager to switch. These private platforms have a "first-mover advantage"
- Different purposes: While both can make payments fast and cheap, CBDCs are direct digital money from the central bank, which means they are very safe because the central bank backs them directly, like cash. E-money, on the other hand, is usually money held by private companies, even if it's very convenient.
- Interoperability: Central banks want CBDCs to work smoothly with existing systems so you can easily move money between your CBDC wallet and your regular bank or e-money accounts. This makes the whole payment system more efficient and resilient
- Innovation: CBDCs can actually encourage these private systems to become even better

Challenges for CBDC: It's tough for CBDCs to gain as much popularity as these already well-loved apps, especially if they don't offer many new benefits to users. People are used to the extra services and features offered by platforms like WeChat (like chatting and videos).

So, in the future, you'll likely have your CBDC alongside your cash and your favorite payment apps, giving you more ways to manage and spend your money. It's about a "multi-rail future" where different payment methods exist together to make payments easier and safer for everyone.

## CDBC Benefits
The vision and mission (the big dreams and main goals) behind having a CBDC are all about making money and payments better and safer in a world where more and more things are done digitally. Central banks around the world, like the People's Bank of China (PBOC) with its e-CNY, are exploring CBDCs to achieve several important things:

- Financial Innovation: CBDCs are meant to be like a new invention for money, helping to modernize payment systems with cool new technologies. The idea is to make sure that the central bank's money (the safest kind) stays useful and important as we all use more digital payments
- Access to Safe Money: As fewer people use physical cash, CBDCs would make sure that everyone, even grown-ups and businesses, still has access to super safe money directly from the central bank in a digital form. This means your digital money is as secure as cash, with no worries about banks going out of business
- Improving Payments: CBDCs aim to make paying for things faster, more efficient, and potentially cheaper. They could allow money to move instantly between people and businesses, reducing delays and costs
- Helping Everyone Access Money (Financial Inclusion): A big goal is to help people who might not have a regular bank account (sometimes called "unbanked") or who have trouble getting financial services. CBDCs could offer an easy, safe digital way to pay and get paid, often just using a mobile phone, even in places with limited internet through "offline payments". They could also make it easier to get started by needing less "identity paperwork" for small, low-risk payments.
-  "Smart Money" (Programmability): This is a really cool feature! CBDCs can be "programmable" using smart contracts. This means you can set rules for how the money is spent. For example, if a government gives money to families for school, it could be programmed so it can only be used to buy school supplies, or it could even return if it's not spent by a certain date. This also helps protect money paid in advance, like for gym memberships, so you get it back if the business closes.
- Fighting Crime and Increasing Transparency: While keeping some privacy for users, CBDCs can offer new ways for central banks to see how money moves, which can help stop illegal activities like money laundering and funding bad things. For bigger amounts of money, the central bank might be able to trace exactly where it goes.
- Easier International Payments: CBDCs have the power to make sending money across countries cheaper, faster, and simpler. This is because they can reduce the number of steps and middlemen involved in sending money from one country to another.
- Helping the Economy (Monetary Policy Effectiveness): CBDCs could give central banks more "tools" to manage the country's economy, like making it easier to encourage spending when needed or to get money to people quickly in emergencies

## Disadventages of CDBC

### Less Privacy, More Watching Eyes
- Imagine if every time you bought candy or a toy, a record was kept by the central bank. That's what could happen with CBDC. Unlike cash, which is private, digital CBDC transactions can be easily tracked
- People worry this means governments could watch all your financial moves, potentially affecting your freedom. Some believe that private companies like Alipay and WeChat Pay already collect a lot of data, but they often offer more "fun" services with it, and some people trust them more than the government with their data

### The Government Might Have Too Much Control Over Your Money
- With CBDC, your money could become "programmable." This means it could have rules built into it
- For example, the government could put "best-before" dates on your money, forcing you to spend it quickly before it becomes worthless. Or they could set limits on how much you can spend (spending caps), or how much you can send to someone (transfer limits). They could even stop you from sending money to certain people or places (transfer blocks)
- In extreme cases, this could mean your money could be "geo-fenced," meaning you could only spend it in certain areas, or even "curfew enforced," stopping you from spending during certain hours. This kind of control could limit your economic freedom and even human rights
- They could even make you lend money to the government (forced loans) or charge you extra "penalty taxes" if you buy certain things they don't like (like junk food or things not considered "green"

### Risk to Regular Banks
If everyone starts putting their digital money directly with the central bank through CBDC, regular banks might lose a lot of their deposits. This could make it harder for banks to lend money to people and businesses, potentially making loans more expensive and harming the entire financial system. This is called "bank disintermediation."

### Cyber Attacks and Technical Problems
- Because CBDC is digital, it could be a big target for hackers. A successful attack could mean fake money, stolen funds, or the whole payment system crashing, which would be a huge problem for everyone and make people lose trust
- CBDC also relies on electricity and internet. If there's a power cut or the internet goes down, you might not be able to access your money, especially in places that don't always have reliable power or internet

### Hard to Get People to Use It
- Even with lots of promotions and incentives (like digital coupons), people in places like China have been reluctant to switch from their favorite payment apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay to the e-CNY (China's CBDC). Why? Because the existing apps are already super convenient and offer many other services like chatting and video sharing that CBDCs don't
- CBDCs need people and businesses to use them to be successful, and it's hard to convince them if they don't see a clear benefit over what they already use

### Expensive for the Central Bank
Creating and maintaining a CBDC system is very expensive for the central bank and other involved parties, requiring constant updates and security measures

## Type of CBDC

### Retail CBDC (for everyday people and shops)
- This is like the digital cash you and your parents would use every day. 
- The central bank would be directly responsible for this money, just like it is for the paper money in your pocket. This means if a regular bank had problems, your retail CBDC would still be super safe because it's a direct promise from the central bank itself.
- People could use it for all sorts of things, like buying snacks at a shop, paying for online games, getting salaries, paying taxes, or even receiving government help.

### Wholesale CBDC (for big banks and financial companies)
- This type of CBDC is not for you or me to use directly. It's special digital money just for financial institutions like big banks to send huge amounts of money to each other.
- Think of it like a super-fast, super-safe digital highway just for banks to make very large and important payments. It helps them settle big transactions, like when they trade stocks or other financial assets.
- One project, called "Project Aber," was a collaboration between the central banks of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to test a wholesale CBDC for payments between their banks, aiming to make transfers faster and cheaper

### Cross-Border CBDC (for sending money between countries)
- This type focuses on making it easier, faster, and cheaper to send money from one country to another
- Right now, sending money internationally can be slow and expensive because it involves many different banks and rules in different countries
- Cross-border CBDCs would try to fix this by letting different countries' CBDC networks "talk" to each other directly under the supervision of central banks. This could help reduce risks and delays
- For example, there's a project called "mBridge" which is a wholesale CBDC project that has reached a stage where it can support basic functions for real international money transfers

In simple terms, retail CBDCs are for everyone's daily spending, wholesale CBDCs are for big money moves between banks, and cross-border CBDCs are designed to connect different countries' digital money systems to make international payments better

## Global Adoption & Status
- As of late 2023 or early 2024, almost all central banks (about 93% to 94% of 86 surveyed ones) are doing some kind of work on CBDCs, like researching or experimenting
- It's expected that by 2030, about 15 countries might have officially launched their CBDCs
- In early 2023, about 114 countries were looking into CBDCs, and by early 2023, this number went up to 119 countries. These countries make up a huge chunk of the world's economy – about 95% of global GDP

### Who Has Already Launched a CBDC
- The Bahamas has the Sand Dollar
- Jamaica has Jam-Dex
- Nigeria has the eNaira
- Also, 11 countries in the Eastern Caribbean Basin have launched CBDCs
- China has been doing pilot tests of its e-CNY in 17 provinces for several years, with government and companies increasingly using it for payroll
- The European Central Bank (ECB) is in the "preparation phase" for a digital euro, figuring out the rules and choosing companies to build it. They might start building it in November 2025
- The Bank of England (BoE) is in the "design phase" for a digital pound in the UK, looking at technology and rules
- India has a retail CBDC pilot with about five million users and is adding features like offline payment
- South Korea is exploring both retail and wholesale CBDCs and plans a public test
- Kazakhstan has already decided to issue a retail CBDC, called the Digital Tenge (DT), and launched it in "pilot mode" in late 2023

So, the world is still very much in the early days of CBDCs, with lots of experiments happening, but many challenges to overcome before they become a common way for everyone to pay.

### How Well Are They Doing? (Are People Using Them?)
Even though these countries have launched their CBDCs, people haven't rushed to use them much. It's been pretty slow so far
- In The Bahamas, after about three years, only about 100,000 wallets were created by March 2023, which is only about 25% of the grown-up population
- In Nigeria, after one year, only about 900,000 wallets were opened, which is just 0.5% of their huge population
-  In China, even with lots of advertising and gifts (like digital coupons called "red envelopes"), people mostly still use their existing payment apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay and don't really want to switch to the e-CNY (China's CBDC). The amount of e-CNY in circulation is very tiny compared to other money (only 0.16% of M0, which is like the total cash in the economy). The average e-CNY balance per person is only about 11.78 yuan (roughly $1.60)

### Why Aren't People Rushing to Use Them?
- They like what they already have! In places like China, popular apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay are super convenient, offer lots of extra features (like chatting and videos), and people don't see a big reason to switch
- Not enough people know about them. There hasn't been enough education to explain what CBDCs are and how they help
- Not enough shops accept them. It's like a "chicken-and-egg" problem: users won't use it if shops don't take it, and shops won't take it if users don't have it
- Worries about privacy. Some people are concerned that digital CBDC transactions can be easily tracked by the government, which makes them prefer private cash or existing private apps
- Not enough "freebies" or rewards. While incentives like digital "red envelopes" (coupons) have encouraged some to try it, it's hard to keep people using it consistently
- It's expensive for banks to set up. Regular banks have to spend extra money to make their systems work with CBDCs and they don't earn much from it, so they're not always excited to push it
